        <p>Ice cream is a frozen dessert made from a mixture of cream, milk, sugar, and flavorings
        that is chilled and churned. It originated thousands of years ago as flavored snow
        and evolved in Italy before spreading to the rest of the world. Modern ice cream is produced in 
        factories using large machines and comes in many varieties, such as frozen yogurt, sorbet, and 
        non-dairy options.</p></br>
