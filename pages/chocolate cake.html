       <h3>Choclate Cake</h3>
       <p>The history of chocolate cake dates back to the 17th century, when cocoa powder from the Americas was added to existing cake recipes.
        In 1828, a new process for extracting fat from cacao liquor, developed by Coenraad van Houten, made cocoa powder more accessible and affordable.Until the 1890s, chocolate recipes mostly focused on beverages. Early "chocolate cakes" often referred to white or yellow cakes with chocolate frosting, or cakes that were much lighter.</p>
